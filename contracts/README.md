**HoneyPotUndetect** is a smart contract honeypot developed strictly for **educational purposes**. It is not intended to cause harm, deceive, or facilitate malicious activities. This project aims to illustrate certain smart contract mechanics and their implications.

## Purpose

This honeypot demonstrates how transactional thresholds and smart contract design can lead to undetectable deceptive behaviors. It remains undetectable until a specific number of transactions are processed, making it a useful example for understanding the potential risks in decentralized finance (DeFi).

## How It Works

1. **Transaction Thresholds**:
   - The contract implements thresholds to maintain normal behavior until certain transaction limits are reached:
     - `_reduceBuyTaxAt = 15` transactions.
     - `_reduceSellTaxAt = 15` transactions.
     - `_preventSwapBefore = 15` transactions.

2. **Fee Collection Simulation**:
   - The contract collects fees on transactions and attempts to send them to a predefined developer wallet (`_devWallet`).

3. **Reverting Transactions**:
   - When the fees are sent to `_devWallet`, which mimics a wallet address but does not implement the `receive` function, the transaction **reverts**. This behavior makes it impossible to sell the token after the transaction threshold is reached.

4. **Post-Threshold Behavior**:
   - Before 15 transactions: The token behaves like a standard token with configurable buy/sell taxes.
   - After 15 transactions: The sell mechanism fails, effectively locking liquidity and exposing the honeypot behavior.

## Key Features

- **Undetectable Design**: Remains indistinguishable from a normal token until the 15-transaction threshold is reached.
- **Educational Use Case**: Helps developers and researchers understand how transactional thresholds and fallback mechanisms can be exploited in smart contracts.

## Disclaimer

- This contract is intended **only for learning and research purposes**.
- Deploying or using this contract in live environments with malicious intent is unethical and may violate legal regulations.
- The authors are not responsible for any misuse of this code.

## Security Insights

1. **Developer Wallet (`_devWallet`)**:
   - The wallet address is defined as `address payable private _devWallet`.
   - Transactions revert when fees are sent to this address if it does not include a `receive` function.

2. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Users interacting with unknown tokens should verify the token's contract logic thoroughly before making transactions.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of due diligence in smart contract interactions. It serves as a practical example for developers and auditors to understand deceptive mechanics in DeFi contracts.
